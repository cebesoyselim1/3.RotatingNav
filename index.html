            The researchers had not set out to study the song of the regent honeyeater, but simply to find the birds.

            "They're so rare and the area they could occupy is so big - probably 10 times the size of the UK - that we were looking for a needle in a haystack," said Dr Crates.

            During this painstaking search, he started to notice birds that were "singing weird songs".

            He recalled: "They didn't sound anything like a regent honeyeater - they sounded like different species."

            Songbirds learn their songs the same way that humans learn how to speak.

            "As young birds, when they leave the nest and go out into the big wide world, they need to associate with other, older males so they can listen to them sing and repeat that song over time," said Dr Crates.

            The regent honeyeater, which has lost about 90% of its habitat, now has such a small, sparsely distributed population that young males are simply unable to find other males and hear their songs.

            "So they end up learning the songs of other species," Dr Crates explained.

            The natural song of the regent honeyeater has essentially "disappeared" in 12% of the population, the research revealed.

            Dr Sue Anne Zollinger, an expert in animal communication from Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK, said the research demonstrated how songbirds need the chance to listen to and learn from others, "the same way that human children need a rich linguistic experience when young in order to speak fluently as adults".

            "This study shows how damaging population declines and habitat fragmentation might be to this critical process in the life of songbirds," she commented.
